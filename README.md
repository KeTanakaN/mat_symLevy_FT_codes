Matlab codes for the symmetric Levy processes
====================

Matlab R2013a (8.1.0.604) codes for numerically solving the Kolmogorov forward equations for the symmetric L´evy processes. 

These codes were used to yield the results of the numerical experiments in my article

"A fast and accurate numerical method for the symmetric L´evy processes 
 based on the Fourier transform and sinc-Gauss sampling formula"
(http://arxiv.org/abs/ ).

See this article for the technical details of the numerical method.

The roles of the source files and their relationships are explained below.
